 For this assesmnt I have decided that I need to split the code into different segments
 
 * I needed to import the datset
 * Then split the names and sort them alphabetically into a table with coulmn numbers
 * I needed to handle expection incase the data was invalid such as contianing numbers or not being in uppercase
 * I then needed to calcualate the names nuimerical result for each name, by determing the ASCII value for each letter and adding them up
 * Then I needed to work out the total result for each name so muliptlying names numerical result by the coumn number
 * Finally output the sum of all of the total results
