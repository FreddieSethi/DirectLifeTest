For this assessment, I have decided that I need to split the code into different segments.

I needed to import the dataset.
Then, split the names and sort them alphabetically into a table with column numbers.
I needed to handle exceptions in case the data was invalid, such as containing numbers or not being in uppercase.
I then needed to calculate the names' numerical result for each name by determining the ASCII value for each letter and adding them up.
Afterward, I needed to work out the total result for each name by multiplying the name's numerical result by the column number.
Finally, output the sum of all the total results.
